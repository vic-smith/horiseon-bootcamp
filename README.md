# horiseon-bootcamp
In this project I was tasked with cleaning and organizing existing code for the Horiseon webpage. 
I condensed repeticious code and referenced common selectors using the same css class. 
Then I organized the css stylesheet to follow the order of the webpage.
Finally I added alt descriptions for the images on the page and verified that all links work properly.
To complete the project I created a new repository and pushed all the relevant files to github.
